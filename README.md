# ImageQC
## brief introduction
STOmics microscope ImageQC software is intended for assessing the quality of microscope images. Besides resolution and sharpness, it also evaluates stitching quality of a STOmics chip image by referring to the background track lines. The ImageQC software has two main applications. Firstly, a fluorescent image of a tissue mounted S1 chip (STOmics, Cat. No.: 1000028487) should pass the ImageQC evaluation to ensure that it fulfills requirements for the downstream data analysis via SAW pipelines. Secondly, with the aid of a STOmics test chip (BGI, Cat. No.: 1000029779), the software can also be used to assess if a microscope is compatible with the STOmics protocols. 

 
## Computer system requirements 

•	Hardware requirement: memory of at least 16G.

•	Operating system: Windows 10 - 64 bit 

•	Connection requirement: not necessary unless image uploading to a computer cluster or cloud is required (refer to section 4.2, step 10 for details).
